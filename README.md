Some publicly shared app ideas

# apps

- [ ] Make https://templates.netlify.com/ dynamic and filterable.

- [ ] Fourth Dimension
   - 3D based timeline, allowing you to travel in the 4th Dimension. Useful for representing historic events, or any event.

- [x] [Static uptime robot](https://static-uptime-robot.netlify.com/):
   - Make use of lambda functions to fetch a configurable site from the cloud and respond if the site is "up and running". Uses a cron job to update its status. Currently reduced its frecuency to once per month due to build costs in the Netlify CD pipes. Left as a usage showcase of Netlify Functions + scheduled Github Actions.
