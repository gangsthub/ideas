> Some publicly shared app ideas

## apps

- ~[ ] Make https://templates.netlify.com/ dynamic and filterable.~

  - it was made in: https://www.netlify.com/integrations/templates/

- [x] Static uptime robot (link no longer available) (Currently disabled because it was eating all my build minutes on Netlify [$$]):

  - Make use of lambda functions to fetch a configurable site from the cloud and respond if the site is "up and running". Uses a cron job to update its status. Currently reduced its frequency to once per month due to building costs in the Netlify CD pipes. Left as a usage showcase of Netlify Functions + scheduled Github Actions.

- [ ] An app that creates apps that create apps, for money of course. Keep adding levels.

- [ ] "vault", safe password management for freelance clients.

- [ ] Crops calendar, and seasonal vegetables. Location-based. I'm sure there are similar apps out there. Ability to create your own crops and their seasons.

- [ ] ~ChronoSport. An app with configurable chronometers for working out. I usually miss the ability to set milestones in a timer so I get notified at specific times.~
   - Found a respetable app that does mostly what I wanted! https://secuso.aifb.kit.edu/Intervalltimer_und_Zirkeltraining.php

## APIs

- [ ] Odds API. `/api/1/10/-3`: translated into `1*10^-3` things that you have those odds to happen to you.

## Activities

- [ ] Create an animated series of videos: "muppettps" (or "httpets"), SVG animated videos explaining internet-related and web development stuff.

## Browser Extensions

- [ ] A browser extension that "highlights" parts of the content of a page that has been generated by an AI, with some certainty (different highlight colours for different levels of certainty?). Users need to provide their own OpenAI API KEY for it to work (I'm not paying).

## Others

- [ ] idea representation language. Diagram-like language to represent an idea.
