Some publicly shared app ideas

# apps

- [ ] Make https://templates.netlify.com/ dynamic and filterable.

- [ ] Fourth Dimension (AKA "Timeline", the real TL)
   - 3D based timeline, allowing you to travel in the 4th Dimension. Useful for representing historic events, or any event. Milestones can be images, videos, texts, a combination of them..., another timeline (time travel), .

- [x] [Static uptime robot](https://static-uptime-robot.netlify.com/) (Currently disabled because it was eating all my build minutes on Netlify [$$], but still functional):
   - Make use of lambda functions to fetch a configurable site from the cloud and respond if the site is "up and running". Uses a cron job to update its status. Currently reduced its frequency to once per month due to building costs in the Netlify CD pipes. Left as a usage showcase of Netlify Functions + scheduled Github Actions.

- [ ] App that creates apps that create apps, for money of course. Keep adding levels.

- [ ] "vault", safe password management for clients.

- [ ] Crops calendar, and seasonal vegetables. Location-based. I'm sure there are similar apps out there. Ability to create your plants calendar.

- [ ] "Can I Mix", like caniuse but comparing 2 or more features. It auto-highlights the intersection between them.

# activities

- [ ] Create a animated series videos: "muppettps" (or "httpets"), SVG animated videos explaining internet-related and web developemtn stuff.
